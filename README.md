## Description

Welcome to the Employee Payroll Tracker, a dynamic application designed to revolutionize the way payroll managers organize and visualize payroll data. This application, developed through this week's Challenge, extends functionality to an existing starter code base to create a user-friendly, browser-run application. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, alongside meticulously crafted HTML and CSS, the Payroll Tracker provides a seamless experience for managing employee payroll information.

### User Story

SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
Features
```

- **Dynamic Employee Addition:** Easily add employees to the payroll system through a user-friendly interface. Clicking the "Add employee" button initiates a prompt for entering the employee's first name, last name, and salary.
- **Continuous Data Entry:** After adding an employee, choose to continue adding more employees or cancel to end the session. This allows for flexible data management as per the user's convenience.
- **Data Visualization:** Upon choosing to cancel, the application displays all entered employee data on the page. This data is sorted alphabetically by the last name for easy navigation and understanding.
- **Aggregated Data Display:** The console not only shows individual employee data but also computes and displays aggregated data, offering valuable insights at a glance.
